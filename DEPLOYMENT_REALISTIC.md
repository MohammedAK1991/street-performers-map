# ðŸŽ¯ Realistic Production Deployment

## Phase 1: Test Locally First (30 minutes)

### Step 1: Test Production Build Locally
```bash
# 1. Build everything
pnpm build

# 2. Test backend with production env
cd apps/backend
NODE_ENV=production pnpm start

# 3. Test frontend build
cd apps/frontend  
pnpm preview

# 4. Test they communicate
curl http://localhost:3001/health
# Should return: {"status": "ok"}
```

### Step 2: Set Up External Services
- [ ] MongoDB Atlas cluster (free)
- [ ] Get connection string
- [ ] Test local connection with production DB

## Phase 2: Deploy Backend Only (Railway)

### Why Backend First?
- Easier to debug API issues
- Frontend can point to Railway URL
- Test database connections in prod

### Railway Setup
```bash
# 1. Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# 2. Login and deploy
railway login
railway link  # Link to your project
railway up    # Deploy backend
```

### Test Backend in Production
```bash
# Health check
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health

# Test database connection
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/v1/performances
```

## Phase 3: Deploy Frontend (Netlify)

### Only After Backend Works
- Set VITE_API_URL to Railway backend URL
- Test frontend connects to production API
- Deploy to Netlify

## Phase 4: Test Full Flow

### Critical Tests
- [ ] User registration works
- [ ] Performance creation works  
- [ ] Map loads performances
- [ ] Stripe test payment works

## Alternative: Single Platform Deployment

### Vercel Full-Stack (Easier)
Instead of splitting, deploy everything to Vercel:
- Frontend as static site
- Backend as serverless functions
- Single platform = fewer issues

### Railway Full-Stack (Simplest)
- Deploy entire monorepo to Railway
- Railway builds both frontend and backend
- Serve frontend as static files from backend

```javascript
// Add to backend Express app
app.use(express.static('../../frontend/dist'));
app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '../../frontend/dist/index.html'));
});
```

## What I Recommend

### Option A: Split Deployment (More Complex)
- Good for learning microservices
- More potential issues
- Industry standard approach

### Option B: Single Platform (Simpler)
- Deploy everything to Railway
- Fewer configuration issues  
- Easier to debug

### Option C: Test Everything Locally First
- Get it working with production DB locally
- Then choose deployment strategy
- Lower risk approach

## Environment Variables Reality Check

You'll need to set these in MULTIPLE places:

### Railway (Backend)
```env
NODE_ENV=production
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
# ... 15+ more variables
```

### Netlify (Frontend) 
```env
VITE_API_URL=https://backend.railway.app/api/v1
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
# ... 5+ more variables
```

This is where mistakes happen!

## My Honest Recommendation

1. **Start simple**: Deploy to Railway only (backend + frontend)
2. **Get it working**: Test with production database
3. **Then optimize**: Split to separate platforms later
